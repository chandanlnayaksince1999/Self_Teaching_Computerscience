## Core CS

All coursework under Core CS is **required**, unless otherwise indicated.

### Core programming
**Topics covered**:
`functional programming`
`design for testing`
`program requirements`
`common design patterns`
`unit testing`
`object-oriented design`
`static typing`
`dynamic typing`
`ML-family languages (via Standard ML)`
